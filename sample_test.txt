Since the mid-20th century, the pace of climate change has dramatically accelerated due to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. The consequences include rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events. Scientists around the world agree that immediate action is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources to prevent catastrophic impacts on ecosystems and human societies.
